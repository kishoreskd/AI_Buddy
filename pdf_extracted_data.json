        "text": "Injection Techniques  Injections are the art of giving medications through the use of a needle and syringe.  There are several  different routes for giving an injection and are often subject to the desired therapeutic effect and the  patient’s safety and comfort  Injections are usually used when a rapid action is required, if the drug is altered by intestinal sections  or cannot be absorbed by the alimentary tract, when the patient is unable to take the medication  orally or the drug is not available in an oral form.    Equipment Required:  •  Drug to be administered  •  Clean tray  •  Needles and syringe    •  Alcohol wipe  •  Prescription and recording chart  •  Gloves or protective clothing as per hospital policy  •  Sharps bin",

Do not  assume that the prescription has been written  up correctly. • Ask the patient details of their name and if  they have any allergies. Check against the  prescription chart. Check the details about the  indication for the drug, dose, route, and  contraindications with the BNF.  • Make sure the date and time are correct.",

Factors include:  o The needle  o The chemical composition of the drugs/ solution  o The technique  o The speed of the injection  o The volume of the drug  •  Anaphylaxis  •  Long and short term nerve damage  •  Intramuscular haemorrhage  •  Hitting a blood vessel  •  Sterile abscess  •  Lipodystrophy  •  Build up of drug if areas not rotated    The Subcutaneous Route:  The subcutaneous (SC) route is used for a slow sustained absorption of medication, up to 1 - 2 ml  being injected into the subcutaneous tissue. Amongst the drugs that may be injected using this route  are insulin or anticoagulants, which require a slow steady release. The technique is relatively pain  free, and sites are often suitable for frequent injections.   Site for subcutaneous route:  Subcutaneous  •  Outer area of the arm  •  The abdomen (except a 2 inch area around the navel)  •  Lateral aspects of thigh  •  The principle to remember is that the drug should be administered into the fat or connective  tissue underlying the dermis and not the muscle  •  If the area is inflamed or oedematous or sites that contain moles/ scar tissue or other lesions  should not be used.",

        "text": "The Intramuscular Route:  Intramuscular injections deliver medication into well perfused muscle, providing rapid systemic  action and absorbing fairly large doses, these being from 1 ml in a deltoid, to 5 ml in the  ventrogluteal site (half these doses in children).   The choice of site should take in to account the general physical condition of the patient, age, and  the amount of drug being delivered. The chosen site should be inspected for contraindications of  inflammation, infection, or swelling. If the patient is elderly frail with reduced muscle mass, ensure  you ‘bunch up’ the muscle to ensure adequate bulk before injecting.   Sites for intramuscular procedure:  •  Deltoid muscle of the upper arm – preferred site for vaccinations in adult  •  Dorsogluteal – performed by entering the gluteus maximus muscle. Care should be given to  avoid damage to the sciatic nerve and vessels surrounding this area  •  Ventrogluteal – Safer option which accesses the gluteus medius muscle. (Primary location  for IM as it avoids all major nerves and blood vessels)  •  Vastus lateralis – A quadriceps muscle situated on the outside femur and is used as a  primary site for children.  It does have risks associated to it due to overuse.",
